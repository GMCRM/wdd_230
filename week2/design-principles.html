        <p>
            This website does a great job using the rule of thirds. For example, if you dray to equally speced lines cuting the photo in thirds, the female is nicely placed on the line for the third. The webside is also broken into thirds with the Get Help, Work at SAFE, and Donate, buttons, as well as all of the information down below.

        <p>
        The LG website Exemplifies how white space can help make the site seem more clean and rounded. It shows good design thought with the photo of the TV using the rule of thirds, and then having the text in the other third of the page, nicely centered in that space.
